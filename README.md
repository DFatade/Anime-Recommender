# Anime-Recommender
I personally enjoy watching Anime, so I thought it would be interesting to create a recommendations system of my own! 
After some research I decided to use content filtering for this case. Machine Learning has a lot of meaningful applications
and a recommendations system is definitely one of them. Hope this helps some fans find new content!
